# Overview of Nxext Angular

The Nxext Plugin for Angular contains generators for managing Angular applications and libraries within an Nx workspace . It provides:

- Vite alternative to webpack (@nrwl/angular) && (@nrwl/web) && (@angular-devkit/build-angular:browser)
- Quicker and smaller builds

## Executors / Builders

Our Angular applications are built using the executors from the [@nxext/vite](../vite/overview.md) plugin.
