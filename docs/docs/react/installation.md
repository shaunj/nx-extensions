# Getting Started

At this current moment we don't have an out-of-the-box workspace setup. In order to use @nxext/react you need to create a new NX workspace.

```bash
npx create-nx-workspace --preset=empty
```

After creating the blank workspace, run the following commands:

```bash npm2yarn
npm install -D @nxext/react
```
